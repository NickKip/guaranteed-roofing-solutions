    I recently asked Guaranteed Roofing Solutions to look at our roof as a damp patch appeared on our bedroom ceiling. They attended to it very quickly and efficiently, 
    hence preventing more extensive damage. I certainly would recommend his services.

    My father has a bay window to his lounge, the roof of which has been a long term problem with leaks. Guaranteed Roofing Solutions attended and solved the problem with lead covering. My father is very pleased that this problem has been solved.

    We were very pleased with the replacement of our worn out garage roofing felt with modern long lasting material. The preparation and work done on the day were of a high standard, with great care taken to minimise disruption and clean up afterwards. We have already recommended them to others.

    The guys were polite and professional, did a great job. I would definitely recommend them. I know who to call if I ever need more work done on the roof.

    Fantastic service, came promptly, cleared gutter of blockage, made repairs and fitted a new pipe all for the cost of 
    a call out fee. Great service, I highly recommend.
