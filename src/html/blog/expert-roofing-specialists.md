Roofing is an art.

It has been a part of the construction trade since people first started building houses. As a result, you can find hundreds of capable roofing contractors both locally and online, ready to help you with your construction, maintenance, or repair project. However, not all roofing companies are created equal.

As specialists in the design, supply, and installation of single ply and flat roofing systems, we pride ourselves in offering a bespoke, specialist service for both commercial and domestic needs. 

From garage and shed roofing to guttering, decking, balconies, major commercial properties and more, if you’re looking for flat roofing then <a href="https://www.guaranteedroofingsolutions.co.uk/services/">Guaranteed Roofing Solutions</a> are the only roofing team you’ll ever need.

<h3>A Personal Touch</h3>

As an independent company with an independent spirit, you won’t be frustrated by a call centre when you talk to us, you’ll be talking directly with business owners. Larger roofing companies might be able to offer a different kind of service, but their customer service often leaves something to be desired.

Our team is all about providing quality, exceptional conduct and integrity, and (most importantly when working at height) impeccable health and safety credentials.

<h3>The Experience</h3>

We boast over 5 decades of experience in the UK roofing industry. We’ve evolved with the times whilst staying true to our business morals and impeccable standards. 

We’ve built lasting relationships with our <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2018/06/03/the-roofing-industry-continues-its-upward-slope/">roofing suppliers</a> and have developed techniques and practices that enable us to provide the fastest, most reliable and most cost-effective service around.

<h3>The Specialisation</h3>

Whilst other roofing companies might dabble in single ply and flat roofing, it’s our bread and butter. Whether you’re planning a major commercial installation or a small domestic project (like a home extension or garage conversion), if you’re looking for flat roofing then you’re in the right place. 

<h3>The Light</h3>

We also work with <a href="https://gbr.sarnafil.sika.com/content/united_kingdom/sarnafil/en/roof-refurbishment/our-service-and-support/product-information/accessories/rooflights.html">Sika roof lights</a>, which can elegantly transform your flat-roofed space. By allowing natural light to flood in, they turn gloomy areas into  delightful living spaces. We provide bespoke, energy-efficient roof light solutions in a variety of styles and designs that can also add ventilation to your space.

<h3>The Service</h3>

We strive to provide the very best customer service at Guaranteed Roofing Solutions and believe that only the best is good enough for our customers.

We pride ourselves in treating your property with care and respect, and aim to cause minimal disruption to your daily life.
