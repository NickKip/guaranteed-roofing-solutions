<b>Battens</b> - The strips of wood, metal or plastic that lie horizontally over the joists or the deck and to which roofing tiles or material are secured.

<b>Cladding</b> - Where roofing materials overlap to create a waterproof layer. Sometimes a thin underlay will also be used, particularly when installing slate tiles.

<b>Deck/Decking</b> - The surface of the roof to which the weather-proofing and <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/types-of-roofing.jsp">roofing material</a> (from asphalt and clay to slate and metal) is applied.

<b>Dormer</b> - A structure that projects from a pitched roof and typically contains a window.

<b>Eaves</b> - The underside area of the roof that includes the soffit and the fascia.

</b>Fascia</b> - The part of a pitched roof secured to the rafters that your guttering is typically fastened to. The fascia can be made out of wood or UPVC.

<b>Flashing</b> - A seal installed at various intersections on a roof, generally metal or lead, which exists to prevent water from leaking into the roof.

<b>Flat Roof</b> - An option where the material is laid on instead of tiled. Roofing materials used are generally asphalt, felt or rubber.

<b>Gable</b> - A triangular style of pitched roof with a peak at the top.

<b>Hip</b> - A four-sided pitched roof where all sides are of equal length.

<b>Insulation</b> - The fire-resistant material underneath the roof that traps heat and provides a thermal barrier. It also has sound adsorptive properties.

<b>Joists</b> - The horizontal supports that hold up a flat roof.

<b>Pitched/Sloped Roof</b> - The classic <a href="https://www.homebuilding.co.uk/getting-the-right-pitch/">pitched roof</a> is tiled in either slate, clay or composite shingles.

<b>Ridge</b> - The top of the roof.

<b>Rafters</b> - The wooden framework that supports the roof deck and the roofing above it.

<b>Slope</b> - The slope of a roof is determined by the rise in inches for every 12 inches of horizontal distance.

<b>Soffit</b> - The part of the roof underneath the overhang that is used to seal the space between the wall and the back of the fascia. Soffit is originally an Italian term and was traditionally a wooden board, but is now commonly built with uPVC.

<b>Tiles</b> - Most often made from clay or slate, roofing tiles are laid on top of a deck on a pitched roof. Tiles can either be plain or interlocked, with interlocked tiles offering greater water protection and often made from concrete.

<b>Truss</b> - An additional framework to the rafters that is used to support the roofing. Typically used in situations where heavier roofing materials are used. A truss can be built from either wood or metal.

<b>Valley</b> - The point where two pitched roofs meet.
