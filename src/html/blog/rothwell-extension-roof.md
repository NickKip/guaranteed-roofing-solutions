Another of our projects here at Guaranteed Roofing Solutions was the rear extension to a site in Rothwell, Kettering. To ensure that the roof was of the best quality, and able to withstand wind and rain battering, we used Trocal SGK. Designed to withstand wind uplift forces, it is the perfect choice for maintaining a safe and secure roof. 

With a guaranteed period of 15 years and a BBA lifespan of 35, this roofing solution is one that will offer great, robust protection for a long time to come. The total duration of the installation was approximately 6 hours, meaning our dedicated roofing solution workers were in and out in no time, leaving a secure roof behind.
