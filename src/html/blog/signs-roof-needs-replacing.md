Although replacing a tyre on your car or swapping out an old carpet might be considered a small endeavour, replacing the roof on our homes is a major and expensive job. Not only that, but many of us are simply unaware of the signs to look for when deciding whether or not it's time for a <a href="https://www.guaranteedroofingsolutions.co.uk/services/">roof replacement</a>.

Here, we'll take you through the most obvious signs that you might want to invest in a new roof from an experienced contractor before the damage snowballs and the rest of your house starts to suffer.
 
<h3>It's Looking Bad</h3>
 
Your house is only worth as much as its curb appeal and even though you might consider papering over the cracks and repairing loose shingles at first, it could be time for a complete replacement. 

Check your shingles for streaking or worn areas from a distance, then go in for a closer <a href="https://dronesaferegister.org.uk/blog/what-does-a-roof-inspection-cost-uk/">roof inspection</a> to check for curling, bending and cracks. If there are a number of shingles that require replacing, it might be more cost-effective to replace them all, particularly if your roof is no longer within warranty. 

In addition, you might also notice moss and algae growing on your shingles, which will eventually eat away at them and remove their innate weatherproof qualities. These can be cleaned away, but if the moss has penetrated too far, your shingles might be beyond saving.
 
<h3>The Little Things</h3>
 
There are a number of smaller little 'tells' that it might be time to <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/renovation/a34020/when-to-replace-your-roof/">replace your roof</a>. As shingles begin to deteriorate, small pieces of them will start to break off and fall into the guttering. 

These granules look like small, dark pieces of coarse sand and can be a key sign that your roof is on the way out. Another tell-tale sign is if you notice peeling or bubbling of the paint around the roofline. This is often caused by leaks.

Finally, if the support beams that actually hold up your roof have started to sag or look as if they have been affected by moisture damage then it's time to give your local roofing specialist a call.
 
<h3>Bills, Bills, Bills</h3>
 
If your roof is doing its job, then it's not just protecting you from the elements, but it's <a href="https://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/home-insulation/roof-and-loft">insulating your home</a> against extreme heat and the cold. If you've noticed your energy bills slowly increasing month-after-month and can't seem to pinpoint the reason, it might be that your heater or air conditioning unit is having to work harder to keep your home comfortable. In this case, it could be because heat or cold air is escaping through the roof.
 
<h3>April Showers</h3>
 
After the next major downpour, have a quick look in your attic and see how it's affected the assorted toys and boxes hidden away from prying eyes. If you can spot signs of leakage then it might be something you want to investigate further. 

Also, note that water is not the only thing that can leak through a bad roof ' sunlight too can penetrate through large enough gaps. So, if you can see perfectly in your attic with no lights on, make sure you do something about it.
 
<h3>It's Time</h3>
 
Finally, no structure can last forever and the same is true of your roof. A typical asphalt shingle roof should be replaced around every 30 years, as the asphalt starts to degrade and the shingles begin to wear away. 

Even if everything looks fine on the surface, if your roof is around 40 years old and everyone else in your neighbourhood is <a href="https://www.sheknows.com/home-and-gardening/articles/7729/do-you-need-a-new-roof-ways-to-tell/">getting a new roof</a>, it might be time for you to consider doing likewise.
 
It's a common misconception that our roofs will automatically last at least 20 years (or more), but if the roof has been installed poorly or the material used were sub-par, then age doesn't really mean anything. No matter how old your roof might be, make sure you're checking it regularly and keeping a keen eye out for the signs above.
