Here at Guaranteed Roofing Solutions, we deal with all kinds of roofing jobs. This project took five days to complete, making it one of our larger jobs. We were tasked with the roofing of the main house and its garage, including the fitting of two rooflights with remote control opening capability, and rain sensors for automatic closing when the weather isn√≠t great.

The total area we covered was 300m2 , with a vapour control layer and 150mm of thick single-ply with a 20 year guarantee and a 35 year lifespan. This was definitely an interesting job, and one that we at Guaranteed Roofing Solutions are very proud of.
