                    <h2 class="content-head is-center">What is Single Ply Roofing?</h2>

                    <p>Single ply roofing has become an increasingly popular flat roof covering over the last few years. 
                        Essentially, a single ply membrane roof is comprised of flexible sheets of synthetic polymer that 
                        can be divided into two main groups, thermoplastics and synthetic rubber. Due to the fact that 
                        thermoplastics can be re-heated and re-molded, they have become the number one option for many 
                        industrial, commercial and domestic roofing contractors undertaking flat roof installations.</p>

                    <p>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is recognised as a thermoplastic membrane and has been used as a 
                        single ply membrane roofing material across Europe since the sixties. From the largest of 
                        factory rooftops to much smaller <a href="/garage">garage roofs</a> and bay windows, it can be easily used in a 
                        variety of situations and environments.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-head is-center">The Benefits of Single Ply Roofing</h2>

                    <p>Regardless of the type of roofing material that you’re considering to use, there are many universal 
                        benefits in choosing a Single Ply membrane roof. These include:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Resistant to UV & Natural Elements</strong><br />
                            A fundamental requirement for any roofing material is the assurance that it’s resistant to 
                            damaging ultraviolet light. Not only are most single ply membrane materials 100% UV resistant, 
                            but they’re also not affected by the build up of potentially harmful micro-organisms.
                        </li><br />

                        <li>
                            <strong>Durable</strong><br />
                            When applied with a hot air weld, the single ply roof membrane also provides your building 
                            with some much needed protection against changing weather conditions and even the most extreme 
                            temperatures.
                        </li><br />

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fire Retardant</strong><br />
                            Due to their composition, single ply membrane roofs are also fire resistant and even self-extinguishing. 
                            For any business, organisation or workplace that is concerned about the fire safety of their 
                            employees, visitors or customers then single ply roofing is certain to provide you with both 
                            confidence and security.
                        </li><br />

                        <li>
                            <strong>Resistant to Chemicals</strong><br />
                            For areas that are likely to be exposed to potential harmful chemicals, it’s certainly reassuring to 
                            know your roofing material is protecting yourself and your building against acid rain and other 
                            forms of acidic outflow.
                        </li><br />

                        <li>
                            <strong>Eco-Friendly</strong><br />
                            In comparison to the more traditional industrial roofing materials, single ply membranes are 
                            considerably more environmentally friendly in their production, longevity and ability to be recycled. 
                            Thermoplastic Polyethylene (TPE) is claimed to be the most eco-friendly variation that’s currently 
                            available.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
